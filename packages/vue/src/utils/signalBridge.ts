/**
 * Bridge a core ReadonlySignal<T> into a read-only Vue ref backed by `shallowRef`.
 *
 * We use `shallowRef` (not `ref`) because:
 *   - core signal values are treated as immutable; deep proxying is wasteful
 *   - `Object.is` short-circuits in the core depend on referential equality,
 *     which Vue's deep reactivity would silently break
 *
 * Subscription is torn down via `onScopeDispose`, so this is safe to call
 * inside a Vue component setup, a composable, or a manually-created
 * `effectScope`. Calling it outside any scope still returns a working ref —
 * the caller is then responsible for unsubscribing.
